# solution-pack-multi-tenancy

## Overview

The FortiSOAR™ Incident Response Solution Pack (solution-pack-multi-tenancy) for Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) enables users to experience the power and capability of FortiSOAR™ incident response in a multi-tenant architecture.

## Deploying MSSP IR Solution Pack

**Important**: Before you deploy the solution pack, ensure that you have deployed the FortiSOAR™ Incident Response Solution Pack ([solution-pack-incident-response](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-incident-response)), and there are no records such as alerts, indicators, incidents, etc., in your FortiSOAR™ system.

The steps for deploying a solution pack are mentioned in the [Deploying a Solution Pack](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/how-tos/blob/main/deploying/deployingASolutionPack.md) article.  
**Important**: You must import the solution pack zip on both the 'Master' and the 'Tenant' nodes.

More information about the Multi-Tenancy Solution Pack can be found [here](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-multi-tenancy/blob/develop/docs/MSSPContentPackDoc.md).
